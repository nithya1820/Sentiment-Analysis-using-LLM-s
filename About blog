## Introduction
In our study we mainly focus on the problems addressed below:
•	This research paper addresses the pressing problem of developing effective and robust methods for sentiment analysis in Dravidian languages. 
•	This challenge is becoming worse because of the unique characteristics of these languages, including morphology and script diversity. 
•	We focus on the unique linguistic and cultural characteristics of these languages and the complexity of multimodal data. This is to improve content moderation and user experience within these linguistic communities.


We went through several articles and found some common as well as different issues.
Through my blogs, we will be analysing each paper I have reviewed and providing insights on the topic with referrals and tutorials wherever necessary.
