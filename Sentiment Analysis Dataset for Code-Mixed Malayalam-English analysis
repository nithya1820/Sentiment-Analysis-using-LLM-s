## Name of the conference paper:
Proceedings of the 1st Joint SLTU and CCURL Workshop(SLTU-CCURL 2020)
## Topic:
Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Code-Mixed Malayalam-English
## Year:
2020
## The problems addressed in this study:
Creating code-mixed datasets for Malyalam-English and ensuring enough data are available for research purposes.
## pre-processing:
1)removing emojis
2)filtering out sentences longer than 15 words
3)filtering out monolingual sentences
## Models used:
LR,SVM,RF,DT,MNB,KNN,BERT,DME,CDME
## Solution approach:
A code-mixed dataset for Malayalam-English.The sentences are extracted from YouTube comments and preprocessed to filter out non-code-mixed language identification at the comment level with the langdect library and emojis were also discarded. After a clean dataset is produced it is then annotated based on sentiments such as positive state, negative state etc. and finally the sentiments are classified based on the datasets and the input features are the TF-IDF, this approach makes these models trained without taking any pre-trained embeddings. The result is also shown in the deep learning-based models. The data is then fed inside algorithms such as LR, SVM etc and the dataset is classified and precision, recall,f1-score and support are predicted.
## Results:
All the machine learning algorithms succeed in classifying all the classes except SV.A recall of 1.00 and precision around 0.13 for non-Malayalam class shows that all the classes have been labelled as non-Malayalam irrespectively. Other than SVM, LR, DT, RF shows considerable macro average score for precision, recall and F1-score. However, MNB and KNN achieve higher macro-averaged precision at the expense of the lower recall values.
