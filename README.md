This repository consists of summaries and insights of Sentiment Analysis articles, mainly the problems and findings based on the literature review. Explore this repository to expand your knowledge in this area and also get a hold of some materials and tutorials for you to get into the same.
This literature review was done as part of a pre-internship program and as a group of three, we read 14 articles each on this area and made up our literature review. This repository is a part of a phase for our program. It will include blog-like posts on the findings and issues stumbled upon by the researchers in the read articles and how they have approached them.

- Fine-tuning and feature extraction:
  The dataset set must be adapted to perform a specific task on a pre-trained model.
- Analysing Precision and accuracy
- Analysing the research gap/limitations of the study you did
- Studying future enhancements compared
